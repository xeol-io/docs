# Overview

A secure enclave is a hardware based security feature of some modern CPUs that allows for
cryptographic attestation all code and data running inside an enclave, along with complete isolation and
confidentiality. Enclaves allow the end-user to verify that the code running inside the enclave
has not been tampered with and is running on a trusted system.

This is the secret sauce that powers Xeol and allows us to provide end-to-end confidential LLMs.
When you use Xeol, you can be absolutely sure that we cannot read your prompts or responses,
even if we wanted to.

# Enclave Benefits

The secure enclave promises complete isolation and confidentiality of the data and code
running inside it. This means that the enclave can be used to store and process sensitive
data without the need to trust the system it is running on. This is very powerful in a
SaaS environment where the user does not have control over the system running the service.
A new model of trust is created where the user only needs to trust the enclave and not the SaaS
provider.

Let's take a look at some of the ways enclaves are isolated:
- **Hardware**: An enclave is physically isolated from the rest of the system at the
hardware level. This means it has its own processing and memory resources that cannot
be accessed directly by other components or processes within the system
- **Secure Boot**: The enclave uses a secure boot process to ensure that the code running
inside it is trusted and has not been tampered with. This prevents unauthorized code from
running inside the enclave.
- **Memory Encryption**: The enclave's memory is encrypted with a key that is only known
to the CPU. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt data as it enters and leaves the enclave.
If an attacker were to gain access to the system's memory, they would not be able to read
or manipulate the enclave's memory.
- **Remote Attestation**: The enclave can be remotely attested to prove that it is running
on a trusted system. This is one of the most powerful features of enclaves as it allows
the user to verify that the enclave is running on a trusted system without having to trust
the system itself.

# Attestation

When a user wants to establish communication with an enclave, checks will first be
performed to verify the authenticity of the enclave. This is done by having the enclave
generate a cryptographic proof that can be verified by the user. The proof contains
information about the enclave's identity, the code running inside, and the system it is
running on.

For Xeol, if any of the attestation checks fail, the user will be notified and will be
unable to communicate with the LLM. However, if they succeed, the user can be sure that the
LLM is running on a trusted and confidential system.

# Examples

There are a couple cloud providers that currently offer secure enclaves as a service. Xeol uses
the [AWS Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/) service.
