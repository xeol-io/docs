### EOL Software Tracked
We can track EOL for 2 main types of software, **open source packages** and **commercial software**.

**Open source packages such as:**
- `nuget`, `npm`, `maven`, etc packages that have been marked as deprecated in their respective package registry or archived in repository.

**Commercial software such as:**
- Operating Systems (Linux, Windows, macOS, RHEL, etc)
- Databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc)
- Web Servers (Apache, Nginx, etc)
- Application Servers (Tomcat, JBoss, etc)
- Middleware (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc)
- Development Tools (JDK, .NET, etc)
- Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc)
- Desktop Client Software (Office, Adobe, etc)

### Definition of EOL
<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Vendor Announced" icon="megaphone">
    Official vendor announced end-of-life date for major versions. Usually only available for commercial software.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Registry Deprecated" icon="hand">
    Whether a package is marked as deprecated in the package registry. This is a strong signal that a package is unsupported.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repository Archived" icon="box-archive">
    Date the package source code was archived in repository. This is a strong signal that a package is unsupported.
  </Card>

### EOL Data Consistency

Here is how we ensure our EOL database is consistent and accurate:

**Accuracy**

For each software component, we gather all releases for that software by scraping release data
from the official vendor webiste, source repository, or package registry. We check our
database to ensure the version is tracked in some way. If it isn't, the package version is added to our
queue of versions to be tracked.

**Coverage**

When requests hit our API, we track which requests have been "misses" (no component lifecycle was found).
The missed requests are grouped and manually reviewed by our team that then decides how to proceed for each missed request.
This process ensures that we are constantly increasing our coverage.

**Resiliency**

_Source (vendor site, package respository, etc) has moved_

Each scraper has a heartbeat. If we donâ€™t see new release information every 3 months, a human steps in to investigate.

_Source has changed significantly_

The scraper will error out and trigger an alert to our team which will then investigate and remediate manually.

### FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get an API key to play with your EOL database?">
    Message us at `founders@xeol.io` with your name and company and we will get you an API key to start playing!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What identifiers do you support to match software?">
    We support matching software on `purl` , `cpe` , or `name` + `version`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about EOL data for software that is not listed above?">
    We are always expanding the coverage for our EOL database. Message us at `founders@xeol.io` and we will add the software you want within a week.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often is the EOL data refreshed?">
    Weekly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to parse the different EOL, deprecated, or archived dates myself?">
    No, our API will return a boolean eol field and a datetime eol_date field for each product. We broke it down into different categories (EOL/EOS vs extended support vs deprecated vs archived) to highlight the differences in how commercial software and open source packages treat or signal end-of-life.
