### Definition of EOL
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Vendor Announced" icon="megaphone">
    Official vendor announced end-of-life date for major versions. Usually only available for commercial software.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Registry Deprecated" icon="hand">
    Whether a package is marked as deprecated in the package registry. This is a strong signal that a package is unsupported.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repository Archived" icon="box-archive">
    Date the package source code was archived in repository. This is a strong signal that a package is unsupported.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unmaintained" icon="broom">
    We generate OSSF scores for all packages which is a proxy score for package activity and maintenance state.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

We determine EOL date and state based on the following rule:

EOL = vendor announced EOL date > registry deprecation state > repository archival date > maintenance state

  <Accordion title="Do I have to parse the different EOL, deprecated, or archived dates myself?">
    No, our API will return a boolean eol field and a datetime eol_date field for each product. We broke it down into different categories (EOL/EOS vs extended support vs deprecated vs archived) to highlight the differences in how commercial software and open source packages treat or signal end-of-life.
