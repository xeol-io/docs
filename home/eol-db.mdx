## EOL Database

We have two main tracks of supported software: open source packages and commercial software.

**Packages**

| Ecosystem | Tracked    |
| --------- | ---------- |
| NuGet     | ✅         |
| npm       | ✅         |
| Maven     | ✅         |

- _NuGet_: All packages that have been marked as deprecated on the NuGet package registry.
- _Npm_: The highest impact packages as defined by a download count of 1,000,000 or more per week and depended on by 500 or more other packages.
- _Maven_: The top 10,000 most depended on packages on Maven Central.

**Commercial Software**

The types of commercial software we can track includes:
- Operating Systems _(Linux, Windows, macOS, RHEL)_
- Databases _(MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)_
- Web Servers _(Apache, Nginx, etc.)_
- Application Servers _(Tomcat, JBoss, etc.)_
- Middleware _(RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)_
- Development Tools _(JDK, .NET, etc.)_
- Browsers _(Chrome, Firefox, etc.)_
- Desktop Client Software _(Office, Adobe, etc.)_

### Definition of EOL
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Vendor Announced" icon="megaphone">
    Official vendor announced end-of-life date for major versions. Usually only available for commercial software.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Registry Deprecated" icon="hand">
    Whether a package is marked as deprecated in the package registry. This is a strong signal that a package is unsupported.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repository Archived" icon="box-archive">
    Date the package source code was archived in repository. This is a strong signal that a package is unsupported.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Data Consistency

There are a couple ways we ensure the data in our database is consistent and accurate:

1. For each software component, we gather all releases for that software by scraping release data
from the official source repository, the vendor's website, or the package registry. We check our
database to ensure the version is tracked in some way. If it isn't, the package version is added to our
queue of versions to be tracked.

2. When requests hit our API, we track which requests have been "misses" (no component lifecycle was found).
The missed requests are grouped and manually reviewed by a human who decides how to proceed for each missed request.
This process ensures that we are constantly improving our coverage.

### FAQ
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get an API key to play with your EOL database?">
    Message us at `founders@xeol.io` with your name and company and we will get you an API key to start playing!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What identifiers do you support to match software?">
    We support matching software on `purl` , `cpe` , or `name` + `version`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about EOL data for software that is not listed above?">
    We are always expanding the coverage for our EOL database. Message us at `founders@xeol.io` and we will add the software you want within a week.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often is the EOL data refreshed?">
    Weekly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to parse the different EOL, deprecated, or archived dates myself?">
    No, our API will return a boolean eol field and a datetime eol_date field for each product. We broke it down into different categories (EOL/EOS vs extended support vs deprecated vs archived) to highlight the differences in how commercial software and open source packages treat or signal end-of-life.
