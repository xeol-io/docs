## What is Xeol?
<Tip>Pronounced Zee-O-L. Like EOL (end-of-life) but with a Z in front.</Tip>

Xeol helps secure your software software supply chain by identifying all your end-of-life software from OS to OSS.

<Note>End-of-life (EOL) software are software that are no longer supported by their publishers and thus becomes a potential attack vector.</Note>

We are two technical [founders](https://www.xeol.io/about-us) who met during the founding stages of an AI ðŸ¦„. We have worked with each for 5 years. We have led security, backend, DevOps, and SRE teams in our past lives. If you want to chat with us feel free to shoot us a message at `founders@xeol.io`.
