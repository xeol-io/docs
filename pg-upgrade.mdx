## How does it work?

Check out our demo video below to see how Xeol helps you upgrade Postgres quickly and safely.

If you prefer reading, here's the step-by-step guide 👇

### 1. Pre-Flight Checks ✈️

We start with two databases:

- **Old Database**: The database you want to upgrade
- **New Database**: A database with the same configuration as our old database but with a newer version of Postgres

Xeol starts with a set of checks to ensure that your current database instance is
ready for replication.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Table Checks" icon="square-1" color="#16a34a">
    Validate that all tables have the correct primary keys and constraints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Database Config Checks" icon="square-2" color="#16a34a">
    Validate the the postgres parameters are set to correct values.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


### 2. Replication 🔄

After all the pre-flight checks have passed, Xeol kicks off data replication from your old database to your new database.

<Warning>This step can take some time depending on the size of your database. We carefully monitor resource usage so that the replication process does not impact your production workload.</Warning>

### 3. Traffic Testing 📶

At this stage, we will spin up another database from a snapshot of your old database and do
traffic testing. Xeol will capture 24 hours of SQL queries from your old database
and replay them on this testing database to ensure there are no regressions.

Xeol will look at the following metrics:
- **Performance**: We will compare the performance of the new database against the old database to ensure that the new database is not slower than the old database.
- **Error**: We will compare failed queries and errors between the old and new database to ensure that the new database is not returning more errors than the old database.

In this step, our aim is to boost your confidence that the new database will perform
just as well on production as the old without any regressions.

<Note>Any **regressions** will be surfaced to you within the dashboard so you can investigate them.</Note>

### 4. Cutover ➡️

Finally, Xeol sets your old database to read-only and resets the sequences on the new
database so that new inserts will not conflict with the existing rows from the old database.

At this point, you will be able to point your application to the new database and
start using it.
