## 📝 Summary
This may be a common scenario:

> you: "I should upgrade to the latest version of x, it has banging new features and impressive performance improvments"
>
> you (internal monologue): _I don't want to feel pain anymore_

Then use `bumpgen`!

## 🧰 How does it work?

- It uses [ts-morph](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph) to turn your codebase into an AST to understand code relationships
- Uses the AST to get type definitions for external methods to understand how to use new package versions
- Creates a plan graph DAG to execute things in the correct order to get to the root of problems (ref: [arxiv 2309.12499](https://huggingface.co/papers/2309.12499))


## 🏃 Get Started
To get started, you'll need an OpenAI API key. `gpt-4-turbo-preview` from OpenAI is the only supported model at this time.

Then, run `bumpgen` this:

```
> export LLM_API_KEY="<openai-api-key>"
> cd ~/my-repository
> npm install -g bumpgen
> bumpgen @tanstack/react-query 5.28.14
```

where `@tanstack/react-query` is the package you want to bump and `5.28.14` is the version you want to bump to.
