## How does it work?
Let us walk you through the step-by-step of how Xeol helps you shorten your Postgres upgrade.

### Pre-Flight Checks

</Frame>

Xeol starts with a set of checks to ensure that your current database instance is ready for replication.

    Validate that all tables have the correct primary keys and constraints.

  </Card>

### Replication

</Frame>

After all the pre-flight checks have been validated, Xeol kicks off a logical replication of your current outdated database to a new instance on the desired version number.

<Warning>This step can take some time depending on the size of your database. We set guardrails on resource usage so we do not affect your production instance.</Warning>


### Traffic Testing
<Frame caption="Flood your new database with production traffic">

</Frame>

After replication, Xeol starts traffic testing the new database. 

In this step, our aim is to boost your confidence that the new database will perform just as well on production as the old from both **performance** and **correctness** perspectives.

<Note>Any **regressions** will be surfaced to you within the dashboard so your team can investigate ASAP.</Note>

Xeol floods the new database with production traffic from the past week then give you a **report card** of how your new database did!


### Cutover
Finally, Xeol sets your old database to read-only and resets the sequences on the new database so that new inserts will not conflict with the existing rows from the old database.

Currently, the actual cutover of traffic to your newly upgraded database need to be performed by your engineers.

<Tip>Use [pgbouncer](https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer) to help you achieve a near zero downtime and zero data loss Postgres upgrade.</Tip>
