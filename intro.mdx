## What is Xeol?
Xeol secures the way you use open source by identifying and fixing your end-of-life, outdated, and unmaintained dependencies.

<Note>End-of-life (EOL) software are software that are no longer supported by their publishers and thus no longer receives any security fixes. Outdated and unmaintained generally falls in the category.</Note>

We have led security, backend, DevOps, and SRE teams in our past lives. If you want to chat with us feel free to shoot us a message at `founders@xeol.io`.
